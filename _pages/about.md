<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">
- The project provides a fully automatic and intelligent book-sorting device;
- Created the conveyor running system as a multi-rod side-by-side connection;
- Designed the lifting system as a double platform, with the loading table separated from the sorting table. The electric control system is realised by two screw motors rotating to drive the platform up and down;
- Designed the QR code of the books by using the image acquisition system, using the external colour and positioning sensors, and communicating with the main control microcontroller through the serial port.

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">
- A sag measurement system of high voltage line based on RTK is designed with a line inspection robot as the carrier.
- Through the hanging chain line model and parabolic model, the maximum point of arc droop and the maximum value of arc droop are analyzed, and the parabolic deformation under the centralized load is taken into account to realize the error correction of the maximum value of arc droop.
- A set of user interaction interface based on PyQt5 was designed in Python.
